## Overview
Basketball Counter is a physics-based Unity (C#) project that integrates real-time ball interactions, dynamic scoring mechanics, and progressive difficulty. The project emphasizes clean OOP design, robust data persistence, and high-performance gameplay.

- **Physics-Based Gameplay:** Realistic ball interactions and dynamic scoring.
- **OOP & Data Persistence:** Modular architecture for scalable development and secure player progress tracking.
- **Performance Optimization:** Reduced latency, improved memory usage, and smooth runtime experience.

## Features
1. **Dynamic Difficulty:** The game gradually increases in challenge as you progress.
2. **Scoring & Feedback:** Real-time score updates with clear visual feedback.
3. **Physics Integration:** Accurate 2D physics for shot trajectories, rebounds, and collisions.
4. **Data Persistence:** Player progress is saved and loaded to ensure an engaging user experience.
